# Newton_or_tangent_Method
Newton's Method is built around tangent lines.
The main idea is that if is sufficiently close to a root of ⁢ , then the tangent line to the graph at ⁢ will cross the -axis at a point closer to the root than . 
We start Newton's Method with an initial guess about roughly where the root is.
